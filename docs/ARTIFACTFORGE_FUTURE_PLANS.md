# ArtifactForge Future Development Plans

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Option A - Polish & Deploy
- Fix LangGraph state issues in enhanced workflow
- Resolve data structure mismatches between agents
- Add proper error handling for the workflow
- Integrate with existing Ghostbusters component
- Update project_model_registry.json with ArtifactForge domain
- Connect with AST Graph Database (Neo4j)

## ðŸš€ Option B - Scale & Optimize (Future)
- Focus on performance and scalability
- Add real-time monitoring and automated fixes
- Implement caching for large codebases
- Add parallel processing for correlation
- Optimize memory usage for massive projects

## ðŸŽª Option C - Advanced Features (Future)
- Add machine learning for predictive analysis
- Implement advanced code quality insights
- Add natural language processing for code comments
- Create intelligent code generation suggestions
- Add semantic analysis for code understanding

## ðŸ”§ Option D - 100% Test Pass Rate (IMMEDIATE)
- Use enhanced ArtifactForge to systematically fix all syntax errors
- Apply intelligent fixes based on block analysis
- Validate fixes with AST parsing
- Achieve the original goal of 100% test pass rate

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
- **Option A**: Production-ready ArtifactForge with full integration
- **Option B**: Handle 10,000+ artifacts in under 5 minutes
- **Option C**: Predictive accuracy > 90% for code quality issues
- **Option D**: 100% test pass rate with zero syntax errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Order
1. **Option D** - 100% Test Pass Rate (IMMEDIATE)
2. **Option A** - Polish & Deploy (NEXT)
3. **Option B** - Scale & Optimize (FUTURE)
4. **Option C** - Advanced Features (FUTURE)

## ðŸš€ Implementation Notes
- Enhanced parser with recursive descent is working perfectly
- Block analysis successfully identifies scope-limited fixes
- LangGraph orchestration provides robust multi-agent workflow
- Ready to apply intelligent fixes to achieve 100% test pass rate
