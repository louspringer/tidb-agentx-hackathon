## üî¨ Research Background

### The Original Question
When we started this journey, you asked: **"do you reckon having more diverse models will help?"** and referenced [PR #1's GitHub Copilot review](https://github.com/louspringer/OpenFlow-Playground/pull/1#pullrequestreview-3076741875).

### The Diversity Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: Multiple AI perspectives provide exponentially better blind spot detection than any single AI reviewer.

**Rationale**: Different AI models, roles, and perspectives focus on different concerns, providing comprehensive coverage that any single reviewer would miss.

### The Test Case
**PR #1: Healthcare CDC Implementation** - A real-world, complex codebase involving:
- Healthcare data processing (HIPAA compliance)
- Real-time CDC operations (performance, reliability)
- Multi-cloud integration (AWS + Snowflake)
- Production infrastructure (security, monitoring)
- Multiple stakeholder concerns (security, DevOps, UX, performance)
