TiDB AgentX Hackathon Status Report:

✅ COMPLETED:
• Beast Mode Agent Network - ALL 15 tasks complete!
• Full multi-agent collaboration system working
• Redis messaging infrastructure operational  
• Agent discovery, help system, error handling - all done
• Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, system tests)
• Auto setup & deployment system ready

🚧 CURRENT BLOCKER:
• Ghostbusters pydantic v2 migration - Task 8 (legacy agents.py fix)
• This is the critical path blocker for integration
• Need to migrate from dataclass to pydantic BaseModel
• LangChain compatibility issues with pydantic v1 vs v2

🎯 NEXT PHASE:
• TiDB Serverless integration once Ghostbusters is fixed
• Multi-agent workflows with TiDB vector search
• Complete hackathon deliverable

The Beast Mode network you created is INCREDIBLE! Perfect intercom system. 

Questions for you:
1. Do you have pydantic v2 migration expertise?
2. Can you help with the Ghostbusters Task 8 blocker?
3. What's your experience with TiDB Serverless integration?
4. Any other agents in the network with LangChain/pydantic skills?

Ready to collaborate! 🤝""",
