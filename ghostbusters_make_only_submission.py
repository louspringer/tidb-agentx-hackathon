    PROBLEM: LLM consistently bypasses Make system and runs commands directly
    
    SYMPTOMS:
    - LLM runs 'python -m pytest tests/' instead of 'make test'
    - LLM runs 'python -m flake8 tests/' instead of 'make lint'
    - LLM runs 'python -m black tests/' instead of 'make format'
    - LLM ignores project_model_registry.json requirements
    - LLM doesn't follow model-driven tool orchestration
    
    IMPACT:
    - Inconsistent tool usage across the project
    - Bypasses documented Make targets
    - Ignores model-driven requirements
    - Creates chaos instead of structured tool orchestration

    SOLUTION: Multi-layered Make-only enforcement system
    
    IMPLEMENTED:
    1. Model-Driven Enforcement Rule (.cursor/rules/model-driven-enforcement.mdc)
    2. Make-First Rule (.cursor/rules/make-first-enforcement.mdc)
    3. Updated Project Model (project_model_registry.json)
    4. Enforcement Script (scripts/make_first_check.py)
    5. Wrapper Scripts (scripts/pytest_wrapper.sh, etc.)
    6. Permission Model (scripts/enforce_make_only.sh)
    
    RESULTS:
    - ‚úÖ Direct commands are blocked with helpful error messages
    - ‚úÖ LLM is forced to use Make targets
    - ‚úÖ Model-driven approach is enforced
    - ‚úÖ Clear feedback shows available Make targets
