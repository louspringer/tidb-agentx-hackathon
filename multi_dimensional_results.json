First, **what are you missing by assuming that the standard library is secure enough?** While standard libraries often come with built-in security features, they can still have vulnerabilities or may not be updated regularly. Have you conducted a thorough review of the library\u2019s documentation and any reported vulnerabilities? \n\nNext, consider the implications of **how do you know that you don\u2019t need to worry about token refresh?** Token expiration is a fundamental aspect of OAuth2, and neglecting to implement a refresh mechanism could lead to a poor user experience. What happens when a user\u2019s access token expires while they are actively using your application? \n\nFurthermore, **what are you missing in terms of potential attack vectors?** OAuth2 is not immune to threats such as token leakage or replay attacks. Have you performed a risk assessment to identify how these vulnerabilities could affect your application? \n\nAdditionally, **how do you know that your implementation will comply with best practices?** Security best practices evolve, and relying solely on the standard library may not be sufficient. Have you consulted any security guidelines or frameworks that provide a comprehensive overview of secure OAuth2 implementation?\n\nLastly, **what are you missing in terms of user experience and security?** The absence of a token refresh mechanism could lead to session interruptions, frustrating users.

First, **what are you missing by assuming that the standard library is secure enough?** While standard libraries often come with built-in security features, they can still have vulnerabilities or may not be updated regularly. Have you conducted a thorough review of the library\u2019s documentation and any reported vulnerabilities? \n\nNext, consider the implications of **how do you know that you don\u2019t need to worry about token refresh?** Token expiration is a fundamental aspect of OAuth2, and neglecting to implement a refresh mechanism could lead to a poor user experience. What happens when a user\u2019s access token expires while they are actively using your application? \n\nFurthermore, **what are you missing in terms of potential attack vectors?** OAuth2 is not immune to threats such as token leakage or replay attacks. Have you performed a risk assessment to identify how these vulnerabilities could affect your application? \n\nAdditionally, **how do you know that your implementation will comply with best practices?** Security best practices evolve, and relying solely on the standard library may not be sufficient. Have you consulted any security guidelines or frameworks that provide a comprehensive overview of secure OAuth2 implementation?\n\nLastly, **what are you missing in terms of user experience and security?** The absence of a token refresh mechanism could lead to session interruptions, frustrating users. Have you considered how this might impact user satisfaction and retention? \n\nBy addressing these questions, you can"
