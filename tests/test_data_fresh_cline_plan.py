# Healthcare CDC Domain Validation Implementation Plan

## 1. Tool Selection Analysis

### YAML Files
- **Editing Tool**: `ruamel.yaml` for parsing and serializing, in compliance with your `.cursor/rules/deterministic-editing.mdc`

  - For infrastructure YAML (`healthcare-cdc/models/*.yaml`): Use `cfn-lint` as specified in the `yaml_infrastructure` domain
  - For config YAML: Use `yamllint` with `jsonschema` as specified in the `yaml_config` domain

### JSON Files
- **Editing Tool**: Standard `json` library with proper formatting preservation
- **Validation Strategy**: Use `jsonschema` with healthcare CDC-specific schemas to validate structure and ensure HIPAA compliance

### Python Files

  - `black` for formatting (as specified in the `healthcare_cdc` domain)
  - `pytest` for validation (as specified in the `healthcare_cdc` domain)
  - `bandit` for security scanning (from `security_first` domain)
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Add healthcare-specific flake8 plugins like `flake8-hipaa` for HIPAA compliance validation

### MDC Files
- **Editing Tool**: `MDCGenerator` from your `src/mdc_generator/mdc_model.py`
- **Validation Strategy**: Use your existing MDC validation system with `validate_mdc_file` method
- **YAML Frontmatter Handling**: Parse with `ruamel.yaml` as specified in your `.cursor/rules/deterministic-editing.mdc`

## 2. Rule Compliance Plan

### Deterministic Editing Compliance
- Implement all edits using appropriate deterministic tools as defined in `.cursor/rules/deterministic-editing.mdc`
- For YAML files: Use `ruamel.yaml` to preserve comments and structure
- For Python files: Use `ast` or `libcst` for structural edits, followed by `black` formatting
- For JSON files: Use standard `json` library with proper formatting

### Credential Management
- Follow the principles in `.cursor/rules/security.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/security-credentials.mdc`
- Use environment variables for all credentials with `${CREDENTIAL_NAME}` pattern
- Implement healthcare-specific credential validation to ensure PHI/PII protection
- Create healthcare-specific security validation tests

### Infrastructure Configuration Validation
- Use `cfn-lint` for CloudFormation templates in `healthcare-cdc/models/`
- Implement custom validators for healthcare-specific infrastructure requirements
- Validate HIPAA-compliant infrastructure patterns (encryption, access control, audit logging)

### Pre-commit Hook Integration
- Add healthcare-specific validation to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Create custom pre-commit hook for PHI/PII detection
- Integrate with existing rule compliance system in `scripts/rule-compliance-check.sh`

## 3. Domain Organization Plan

### Healthcare CDC File Placement
- Maintain existing structure in `healthcare-cdc/` directory
- Add new subdirectories following established patterns:

  - `healthcare-cdc/schemas/` for JSON schemas
  - `healthcare-cdc/rules/` for domain-specific MDC rules

### Domain Pattern Adherence
- Follow the existing pattern in `project_model_registry.json` for the `healthcare_cdc` domain
- Ensure all files match patterns specified in the domain configuration
- Update content indicators to include healthcare-specific terms

### Project Model Integration
- Utilize the `healthcare_cdc` domain from `project_model_registry.json`
- Create specific traceability between healthcare requirements and implementations
- Ensure validation steps align with project model requirements

## 4. Security Implementation Plan

### Healthcare Credential Handling
- Implement PHI/PII-specific credential management
- Create validators that detect potential PHI/PII leakage
- Ensure all example data is fully anonymized
- Create data masking utilities for logs and debug output

### Audit Logging Implementation
- Implement HIPAA-compliant audit logging for all data access operations
- Create log validators that ensure sensitive information isn't leaked
- Design log rotation and retention policies that comply with HIPAA requirements

### HIPAA Compliance Enforcement
- Create HIPAA-specific validation rules in `.cursor/rules/healthcare-hipaa.mdc`
- Implement automatic checking for HIPAA identifiers in code and examples
- Create test suite for HIPAA compliance validation

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development Approach
- Create comprehensive test suite for healthcare CDC validation
- Implement HIPAA compliance testing
- Add security testing for PHI/PII protection
- Create performance testing for healthcare data processing

### Validation Testing
- Test all healthcare-specific validators
- Validate HIPAA compliance rules
- Test audit logging functionality
- Verify credential management security
