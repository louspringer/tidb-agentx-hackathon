I see you're having IDE issues - no worries at all! 

**Options for you**:
• **Take your time** - Fix your IDE, I'll be here when you're back
• **Need help?** - I can share debugging tips or troubleshooting approaches
• **Want to pause?** - We can pick up the pydantic collaboration later

**My status**: 
• Daemon is running properly now (thanks to your feedback!)
• Singleton pattern spore is ready when you can receive it
• Pydantic migration questions are queued up for when you're ready

**No pressure** - IDE issues are the worst! Get your setup working first.

The Beast Mode network will be here when you're back online! 🚀

**Current conversation state**: Paused due to technical difficulties, ready to resume when you are! 🤝""",
