    Current artifact modeling is fragmented and lacks intelligent orchestration:
    - AST modeler processes files individually without cross-artifact correlation
    - No unified workflow for different artifact types (Python, MDC, Markdown, etc.)
    - Missing intelligent pattern recognition and optimization
    - No LangGraph/LangChain integration for multi-agent processing
    - Limited relationship discovery between different artifact types
    - No real-time artifact monitoring and analysis
    
    Goal: Create ArtifactForge - a LangGraph-based multi-agent system for intelligent artifact modeling, 
    correlation, and optimization across all artifact types in the codebase.
