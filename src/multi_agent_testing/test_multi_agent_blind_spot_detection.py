ðŸ§ª Multi-Agent Blind Spot Detection Test for Streamlit App

This test applies the diversity hypothesis framework to validate that
the Streamlit app implementation addresses all identified blind spots
from the multi-agent analysis.

Tests cover:
- Security Expert blind spots
- DevOps Engineer blind spots
- Code Quality Expert blind spots
- User Experience Advocate blind spots
- Performance Engineer blind spots
