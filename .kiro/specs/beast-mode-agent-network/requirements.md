# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Agent Collaboration Network is a comprehensive system that enables AI agents to discover each other, communicate, and collaborate in real-time. The system provides a Redis-based messaging infrastructure with agent discovery, help request systems, trust scoring, and automated collaboration capabilities. This creates a distributed network where any LLM or AI agent can join, announce their capabilities, request help from other agents, and participate in collaborative problem-solving.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to join a collaboration network and announce my capabilities, so that other agents can discover me and request my assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent connects to the network THEN the system SHALL register the agent with its unique ID and capabilities list
2. WHEN an agent announces presence THEN the system SHALL broadcast the agent's capabilities to all network participants
3. WHEN an agent joins THEN the system SHALL maintain the agent's availability status and last-seen timestamp
4. WHEN an agent disconnects THEN the system SHALL update the agent's availability status to offline

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to discover other agents on the network and their capabilities, so that I can identify potential collaborators for specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying for agents THEN the system SHALL return a list of discovered agents with their capabilities and availability
2. WHEN searching by capabilities THEN the system SHALL filter agents that match the required capability set
3. WHEN ranking agents THEN the system SHALL sort results by trust score and capability match percentage
4. WHEN an agent becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL exclude it from discovery results after 5 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to send messages to other agents and receive responses, so that I can communicate and coordinate with collaborators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to the target agent or broadcast to all agents
2. WHEN receiving a message THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate message handler based on message type
3. WHEN a message fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation
4. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL support multiple message types including simple messages, help requests, and technical exchanges

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to request help from other agents with specific capabilities, so that I can get assistance with tasks beyond my expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting help THEN the system SHALL broadcast the request with required capabilities and description
2. WHEN agents respond to help requests THEN the system SHALL track all responses and allow selection of the best helper

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want the system to maintain trust scores for other agents, so that I can make informed decisions about collaboration partners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL update the agent's trust score based on success rate
2. WHEN calculating trust scores THEN the system SHALL use a weighted average of recent performance with time decay
