# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ghostbusters multi-agent delusion detection and recovery system currently has pydantic compatibility issues that prevent the full test suite from running. The system uses LangChain/LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration, but there are version conflicts between pydantic v2.0+ (used in the project) and langchain-core dependencies. This creates import errors and prevents proper testing of the Ghostbusters functionality, which is critical for the project's model-driven approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Ghostbusters test suite to run without pydantic compatibility errors, so that I can validate the multi-agent delusion detection system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pytest tests/test_ghostbusters.py` THEN the system SHALL execute all tests without pydantic import errors
2. WHEN importing Ghostbusters components THEN the system SHALL successfully import all agents, validators, and recovery engines without version conflicts
3. WHEN running the full test suite THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% success rate for Ghostbusters tests (currently at 50%)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LangChain/LangGraph integration to work with pydantic v2, so that the multi-agent orchestration functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing GhostbustersOrchestrator THEN the system SHALL create LangGraph workflow without pydantic compatibility errors
2. WHEN running agent detection THEN the system SHALL properly serialize/deserialize DelusionResult objects using pydantic v2
3. WHEN executing the workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain state consistency across all workflow nodes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data models for Ghostbusters components, so that type safety and validation work correctly with pydantic v2.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining DelusionResult models THEN the system SHALL use pydantic v2 BaseModel syntax and features
2. WHEN validating agent results THEN the system SHALL properly validate data structures using pydantic v2 validators
3. WHEN serializing workflow state THEN the system SHALL handle GhostbustersState serialization without type errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency version resolution, so that all packages work together without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve langchain-core and pydantic versions without conflicts
2. WHEN running UV sync THEN the system SHALL install compatible versions of all multi-agent framework dependencies
3. WHEN importing both pydantic and langchain THEN the system SHALL use compatible versions that don't cause import errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the disabled test file to be re-enabled, so that comprehensive Ghostbusters testing is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing pydantic compatibility THEN the system SHALL re-enable tests/test_ghostbusters.py.disabled
2. WHEN running comprehensive tests THEN the system SHALL execute both the current simplified tests and the comprehensive disabled tests
3. WHEN validating test coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve full coverage of all Ghostbusters components
