# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Network requires a distributed messaging infrastructure that can coordinate agents across networks of arbitrary scale while maintaining transactional guarantees and graceful failure recovery. This system must bridge the gap between local transactional consistency and distributed coordination, providing the foundation for multi-agent workflows that span from single developers to massive distributed teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Zero-to-Scale Architecture

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Network operator, I want the messaging system to work seamlessly from a single developer environment to massive distributed deployments, so that the same codebase and patterns work at any scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single developer starts the system THEN the message bus SHALL operate with minimal resource overhead and zero configuration
2. WHEN the system scales to hundreds of agents THEN the message bus SHALL automatically distribute load without manual intervention
3. WHEN the system scales to thousands of nodes THEN the message bus SHALL maintain sub-second message delivery latency
4. IF the system detects resource constraints THEN it SHALL automatically provision additional capacity or gracefully degrade performance
5. WHEN agents join or leave the network THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance without service interruption

### Requirement 2: Transactional Message Coordination

**User Story:** As a multi-agent workflow developer, I want atomic message operations across multiple agents, so that complex workflows either complete entirely or fail cleanly without partial state corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents participate in a workflow THEN all message operations SHALL be atomic within the local transactional boundary
2. WHEN a workflow spans multiple transactional domains THEN the system SHALL use store-and-forward with positive acknowledgment
3. IF any agent in a local transaction fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all related message operations
4. WHEN cross-domain messages are sent THEN the system SHALL guarantee at-least-once delivery with idempotency support
5. IF a cross-domain transaction fails THEN the system SHALL route failed messages to dead letter queues for manual recovery

### Requirement 3: Pluggable Storage Backend

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to choose the appropriate storage backend for my deployment constraints, so that I can optimize for cost, performance, or operational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL support Redis for low-latency development workflows
2. WHEN deploying at scale THEN the system SHALL support TiDB for infinite storage and horizontal scaling
3. WHEN using enterprise environments THEN the system SHALL support PostgreSQL with LISTEN/NOTIFY for existing infrastructure
4. IF switching storage backends THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility without code changes
5. WHEN multiple backends are configured THEN the system SHALL support hybrid deployments with automatic routing

### Requirement 4: Failure Recovery and Observability

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Network administrator, I want comprehensive failure recovery and system observability, so that I can diagnose issues and recover from failures without losing messages or corrupting workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages cannot be delivered THEN the system SHALL route them to dead letter queues with full context
2. WHEN dead letter queues accumulate messages THEN the system SHALL provide SQL-queryable analytics for root cause analysis
3. IF local queues approach capacity limits THEN the system SHALL alert operators and provide backpressure mechanisms
4. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local operation and resync when connectivity returns
5. WHEN system recovery is needed THEN administrators SHALL have tools to replay, redirect, or purge messages safely

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience and API Design

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode agent developer, I want simple, intuitive APIs that hide distributed systems complexity, so that I can focus on agent logic rather than messaging infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending messages THEN agents SHALL use fire-and-forget semantics with automatic reliability
2. WHEN receiving messages THEN agents SHALL get strongly-typed message objects with built-in validation
3. IF message processing fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN debugging workflows THEN developers SHALL have access to message tracing and flow visualization
5. WHEN testing agents THEN the system SHALL provide local test harnesses that mirror production behavior

### Requirement 6: Network Topology and Routing

**User Story:** As a distributed system operator, I want flexible network topologies that can adapt to organizational boundaries and security requirements, so that the Beast Mode Network can operate across complex enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are in the same security domain THEN they SHALL communicate directly through local message buses
2. WHEN agents span security domains THEN the system SHALL route messages through designated gateway nodes
3. IF network topology changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update routing tables without service interruption
4. WHEN implementing security policies THEN the system SHALL support message filtering and access controls at routing boundaries
5. WHEN operating across WAN connections THEN the system SHALL optimize for bandwidth efficiency and connection resilience

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system performance engineer, I want predictable resource usage and performance characteristics, so that I can capacity plan and maintain SLA commitments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message throughput increases THEN the system SHALL scale linearly with additional resources
2. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL spill to persistent storage without message loss
3. IF CPU utilization is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical messages and apply backpressure to non-critical flows
4. WHEN storage grows large THEN the system SHALL provide automatic archival and cleanup policies
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for bottleneck identification

### Requirement 8: Integration and Ecosystem Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Network integrator, I want compatibility with existing messaging systems and development tools, so that I can incrementally adopt the system without disrupting existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the message bus SHALL support standard protocols (AMQP, HTTP, WebSocket)
2. WHEN using development tools THEN the system SHALL provide OpenTelemetry tracing and Prometheus metrics
3. IF legacy systems need integration THEN the system SHALL provide bridge adapters for common message formats
4. WHEN deploying in Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide native operators and service discovery
5. WHEN using CI/CD pipelines THEN the system SHALL support automated testing and deployment workflows

### Requirement 9: Beast Mode Network CLI Tools

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Network developer, I want proper CLI tools for network operations, so that I can post status updates and manage the network without running raw Python commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posting status updates THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated CLI command with proper argument parsing
2. WHEN managing network operations THEN the CLI SHALL support all common Beast Mode Network functions
3. IF CLI commands fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN using the CLI THEN it SHALL support configuration files and environment variables
5. WHEN debugging network issues THEN the CLI SHALL provide verbose logging and diagnostic modes
