## Final Notes

This task list is optimized for **hackathon success over perfect architecture**. Every task is designed to either:

1. **Enable the demo** - Make the presentation possible
2. **Impress judges** - Show TiDB's unique value
3. **Ensure reliability** - Prevent demo day disasters
4. **Meet requirements** - Satisfy contest criteria

**Focus on demo impact over code perfection. We have 6 days to win this hackathon!** 🏆
