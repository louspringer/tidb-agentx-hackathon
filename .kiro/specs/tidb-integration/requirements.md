**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see compelling analytics powered by TiDB, so that I understand why TiDB is superior to other databases for this use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing agent activity THEN the system SHALL show real-time agent statistics from TiDB
2. WHEN analyzing message patterns THEN TiDB queries SHALL reveal agent collaboration insights
3. WHEN demonstrating scalability THEN analytics SHALL show TiDB handling multiple agents efficiently
4. WHEN presenting to judges THEN analytics dashboard SHALL update in real-time during demo
5. WHEN comparing solutions THEN TiDB analytics SHALL clearly demonstrate advantages over Redis-only approach

### Requirement 4: Demo-Ready Integration

**User Story:** As a hackathon presenter, I want seamless integration between Beast Mode Network and TiDB, so that I can deliver a flawless demo that wins the competition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the demo THEN all TiDB integration SHALL work without manual intervention
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN message flow through TiDB SHALL be visible and impressive
3. WHEN showcasing features THEN TiDB integration SHALL highlight unique capabilities
4. WHEN handling demo load THEN the system SHALL perform reliably under presentation conditions
5. WHEN judges ask questions THEN TiDB integration SHALL provide clear answers about architecture benefits

### Requirement 5: Hackathon Submission Compliance

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want the TiDB integration to meet all contest requirements, so that our submission is eligible and competitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting the project THEN TiDB Serverless SHALL be the primary data store
2. WHEN judges evaluate the submission THEN TiDB integration SHALL demonstrate real-world applicability
3. WHEN comparing to other submissions THEN our TiDB usage SHALL be innovative and compelling
4. WHEN documenting the solution THEN TiDB integration SHALL be clearly explained and justified
5. WHEN presenting the business case THEN TiDB value proposition SHALL be crystal clear
